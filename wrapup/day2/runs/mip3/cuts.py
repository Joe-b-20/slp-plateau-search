"""Valid inequalities for the COMPLETE depth-3 model (model3.py).

Every inequality here is a THEOREM about depth-3 MixColumns circuits, so
adding them cannot raise the integer optimum; they only tighten the LP
relaxation (and hence the dual bound that we cite as the lower bound).
Each is justified in its docstring and each is checked against the verified
97-gate depth-3 circuit by control_cuts.py -- a cut violated by a real
depth-3 circuit would be UNSOUND and the bound VACUOUS.

Variables: x_e (e an edge = weight-2 mask), y_m (m a level-2 mask, wt 3 or 4).
A cut is returned as (list_of_x_edges, list_of_y_masks, rhs, kind) meaning
   sum_{e in list} x_e + sum_{m in list} y_m  >=  rhs        (kind='ge')
or with y-coefficients given explicitly for the 'agg' kind.
